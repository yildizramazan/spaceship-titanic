# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic: Cosmic Rescue Prediction
> **Saving passengers lost in the spacetime anomaly through predictive modeling.**

## 📋 Executive Summary
**Built a machine learning model to predict passenger transportation with [X]% accuracy.** 
Key drivers of transportation identified include [Feature A] and [Feature B]. This tool assists rescue operations by prioritizing search efforts, potentially increasing rescue efficiency by [Y]%.

## 💰 Business Impact
*(To be populated after modeling)*
- **Problem Scale:** 13,000 passengers total, ~4,000 missing.
- **Model Value:** optimize search resources by focusing on high-probability transport profiles.
